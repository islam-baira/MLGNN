## 🚀 Overview

Fake news spreading in online social networks has become a major concern. This work proposes **MLGNN**, a hybrid approach that combines:

- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for learning structural and relational features news propagation, and  
- **Metric Learning** for improved latent space representations.

MLGNN effectively detects fake news even in supervised scenarios.
